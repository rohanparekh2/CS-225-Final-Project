**CS 225 Final Project Developmental Log (rohanjp2, kdadi2, amart317)**

**First Week:**
We began working on pokemon.cpp and pokemon.h . Rohan loaded in the data for the pokemon class. Alam created functions and variables for pokemon.h and pokemon.cpp. Kaushal worked on the MakeFile and the project structure.

**Second Week:**
We started worked on our graph files which includes for the time being BFS. Alam worked on BFS and Vertex. Rohan worked on Edge and graph. Kaushal worked on Test Cases and tried to restructure the project as the MakeFIle was having severe issues. 

**Third Week**
This week Kaushal changed the project yet again becasue he is indecisive and the Makefile was still not working. Changed the it so that there is only one MakeFile and the files are in an exdtremelty simplified format. This time the Makefile does actually work and we can check what is outputted in main. Alam finished BSF and Rohan fixed some issues within Pokemon.cpp like where some items within the csv weren't going into the variables as for some reason spaces would mess it up.
