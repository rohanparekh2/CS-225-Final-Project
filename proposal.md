**Leading Question** - Weâ€™ve played pokemon for our entire childhood so we decided that it would be a fun idea to use pokemon as our dataset for this project. We believe that the pokemon community should have a convenient way of searching through the different pokemon from all the generations from various categories like height, weight, type, Pokedex number, etc. From this dataset, we can definitely see if there are any correlations between the different categories of pokemon. By default pokemon within the Pokedex and other websites organize pokemon by their pokemon number. We will attempt to diversify and allow these pokemon to be organized by different standards like their weight and height etc. This can be useful in a variety of different ways. For example, this could help us choose a fire-type pokemon to play within pokemon soul silver.

**Dataset Acquisition and Processing** -  We will download our pokemon data set as a .csv file from this link (https://www.kaggle.com/mariotormo/complete-pokemon-dataset-updated-090420). We will then put this file inside our Github repository. The data is made up of over a thousand pokemon that come from different generations with many different categories, including name, type, classification, height, capture rate, etc. We will store all of this data in a graph that categorizes the pokemon based on their type and capture rates. The vertices of the graph will correspond to all of the different pokemon in the dataset, which will also include their Pokedex number. When two pokemon have the same type and approximately the same catch rate, they will be connected by an edge. If there are any pokemon with insufficient data, we will either remove them from the dataset or create their own component that is not connected to the rest of the graph.
