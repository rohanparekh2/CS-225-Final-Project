**Leading Question** - Weâ€™ve played pokemon for our entire childhood so we decided that it would be a fun idea to use pokemon as our dataset for this project. We believe that the pokemon community should have a convenient way of searching through the different pokemon from all the generations from various categories like height, weight, type, Pokedex number, etc. From this dataset, we can definitely see if there are any correlations between the different categories of pokemon. By default pokemon within the Pokedex and other websites organize pokemon by their pokemon number. We will attempt to diversify and allow these pokemon to be organized by different standards like their weight and height etc. This can be useful in a variety of different ways. For example, this could help us choose a fire-type pokemon to play within pokemon soul silver.
